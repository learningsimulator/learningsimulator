Redis Queue + Progress bar

Add "Preview" to preview in "My Files"

Varning om @start_trial vs @omit

Delete @export-files and images files when figure / "export-icon" is
deleted (either Close All Figures or delete/close-icon). Not (only) at reload.

Issue warning (somehow) if unsupported mpl-props for lines are used in plotly plot , saying "can be changed
using advanced settings" or something like that. Only "color", "linewidth",
"marker" and "markersize" (and "label") are supported.

Tabbed layout with current script on one tab and demo script on the other

Menu: Set font size, color, bgcolor, line height, "color scheme": (font color, bg color, comment color)
Menu: Search/Replace
Menu: Insert block (parameters, variables, phase) - inserts at cursor (or at the end)
Menu: Import demo script (replaces content of entire script window) - warn if nonempty

Logga in/ut uppe till höger - kanske med användarnamnet

Begränsa storlek på plot (width, height)

Begränsa längd på filnamn i export

Make Navbar nice (with Bg-color) "Home, MY Scripts, Log out" 

(DB-)Admin page

Possibility for user to delete account- "This cannot be undone", "will delete all your scripts..."

start_at_1

Check that html element contraints (min, max values, string lengths, required, etc) match db
-1 < legend_{x,y} < 2 kanske?

Add "Download" to the exported files, when checked that it works on PythonAnywhere.
(Man får "Not allowed to load local resource:" i Inspect > Konsol när man kör lokalt.)

"Script ... saved" flash (how to use on single-page site)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40949746/how-to-display-flashing-message-without-reloading-the-page-in-flask

Plot: "Download" button for mpl image plots (instead of having to right-click and save image as)

Plot: Subplot titles workaround
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51592730/how-to-add-title-to-each-subplot-in-plotly-js,

favicon: see warning in console (used before DOM is loaded?)

A clickable question-mark icon for help on some settings, at least plotly/mpl.
(Include "This is the DEFAULT setting - it can be changed in each plot interactively
after the plot is created")

Freeze mpl4 (and maybe other stuff) to make them local.

Skriv ut versionsnummer någonstans (kanske även version av mpl3, plotly, etc.)

Uniform styling of buttons

Move (all) inline styling to css

Hide db passwd, SECRET_KEY, etc.

Report problems - link to GH Issues, maybe landing page
Link to project page (somewhere, maybe landing page)

X Change default filename for exported plotly plots from "figfile..." (newplot)
X to "learning_simulator..." e.dyl.

X Remove default legend pos. (bec. it doesn't work for scripts without @legend,
X and toggling legend with the "Toggle legend" button)

X Buttons for toggle x-grid, y-grid, toggle legend only for plotly plots, not mpl.

X Fix visbility of controls in settings based on plotly/mpl-selection.

X When vector format is chosen, change "image size" to "plot size".

X Toggle x-grid and y-grid only takes first subplot

X Merge in master

X Use "editable mode": https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/ 
  for Plot parameters: Plot title, xlim, ylim, xlabel, ylabel

X Make "control panel" for plots:
X     Plot parameters: Grid on/off toggle button
X     Plot parameters: Legend on/off toggle button
X using https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/ ?




============
Maybe later
============
Move "Default legend position", "Default colors", "Default plot size" to "My Preferences"?

"Plot as" switch buttons instead of drop-down

Log-window?

Inspiration:
https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/ - especially "editable mode"

Make "Name of script" read-only but with an "Edit" button that makes it editable and shows "Save" and "Cancel"

Plots: Responsive layout for plots: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_two_columns_responsive
(Needed?)

Plot: Range sliders?

For Mpl-figures: 
Add "Image size and dpi can be set using
    @figure ... {'figsize', [inches_x, inches_y], 'dpi', dpi}
Add "Note: Can be overwritten by @figure ... { figsize: [width, height] }"


=========================================================
Maybe make issue (later):
=========================================================
Plot parameters: paper color (paper_bgcolor), plot background color (plot_bgcolor)
Plot parameters: Legend on/off, legend positioning
Plot parameters: line color, thickness, marker, marker size, color, etc.

Investigate if use_pyplot=False can be used in Tk frontend. (See issue about crashes.)

For Mpl-figures: Add "Note: Can be overwritten by @figure ... { figsize: [width, height] }"

Take dpi into account: @figure foo {'dpi': 200}
Also add dpi to settings - overwritten by above @figure command, like figsize?

using advanced settings" or something like that. Only "color", "linewidth",
"marker" and "markersize" (and "label") are supported.

X Use "editable mode": https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/ 
  for Plot parameters: Plot title, xlim, ylim, xlabel, ylabel

X Make "control panel" for plots:
X     Plot parameters: Grid on/off toggle button
X     Plot parameters: Legend on/off toggle button
X using https://plotly.com/javascript/custom-buttons/ ?




============
Maybe later
============
Move "Default legend position", "Default colors", "Default plot size" to "My Preferences"?

"Plot as" switch buttons instead of drop-down

Log-window?

Inspiration:
https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/ - especially "editable mode"

Make "Name of script" read-only but with an "Edit" button that makes it editable and shows "Save" and "Cancel"

Plots: Responsive layout for plots: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_two_columns_responsive
(Needed?)

Plot: Range sliders?


=========================================================
Maybe make issue (later):
=========================================================
Plot parameters: paper color (paper_bgcolor), plot background color (plot_bgcolor)
Plot parameters: Legend on/off, legend positioning
Plot parameters: line color, thickness, marker, marker size, color, etc.

Investigate if use_pyplot=False can be used in Tk frontend. (See issue about crashes.)

What is *Learning Simulator*?
*****************************

Below follows a non-technical introduction to *Learning Simulator*.
For a more technical description, see :doc:`background`.
  
The system being simulated consists of a *subject* (or *organism*, *individual*, or *agent*)
interacting with a *world* (or *environment*).
In reality, this could be for example a rat (the subject) in a maze (the world)
choosing which way to go in each intersection.
The world can present different stimuli (from a pre-defined set of stimulus elements
which we call the world's *stimulus repertoire*) to the subject. 
The simulation starts with the world producing the first stimulus.
The subject then responds
to this stimulus with one of the behaviors in the subject's *behavior repertoire*.
As a result, the world produces a new stimulus that the subject responds to, and so on.

The subject associates each stimulus-response pair with a value, that
we call the *associative strength* between the stimulus and the response,
and denote by :math:`v`. 
It measures how
"good" it is to respond with a certain behavior to a certain stimulus.
The subject also associate each stimulus in itself with a value which may or may not
change. Based on earlier interactions, these values are updated after each stimulus
exposure. These values in turn affect the next response decision.
  
For example, if a dove is rewarded (with food, for example) after picking on a lever
when a blue light comes on,
but is not rewarded when picking when the light is red, the next time the light comes on,
the dove is more likely to pick on the lever if the light is blue than if it is red.
In this case, the value of the stimulus-response pair (blue light, pick) increases
over time.
  
In the above example, the animal has learned to pick when a blue light is on.
It is this kind of learning processes that can be simulated in *Learning Simulator*.
The user of the simulator specifies in a text-based scripting language
how the world produces stimuli, as well as a number of other parameters to the
simulation. After a completed simulation, the user can
visualize how the value of certain stimuli or certain stimulus-response pairs
change over time. This script file is the only input to ``Learning Simulator``.
The output is typically one or several plots of these values as a function of
simulation steps (learning curves). These values can also be
exported in csv-format to an external file.

:orphan:

filename
********

Specifies the file to which exporting commands write.

Syntax
------

::

  filename = my_file.csv
  filename = /path/to/my_file.csv

Default
-------

There is no default file. If not specified before an exporting command, an error will occur.

Description
-----------

``filename = my_file.csv`` will make subsequent exporting commands write to the file ``my_file.csv`` in the current directory.

----

``filename = /path/to/my_file.csv`` will make subsequent exporting commands write to the file ``/path/to/my_file.csv`` relative to the current directory.

.. note::

  Note that giving a relative path to a file ``/path/to/my_file.csv`` does not create the folders "path" and "to". They must exist when the export command runs. Otherwise an error will occur.

.. note::

  If the specified file already exists, the existing file will be overwritten without warning.

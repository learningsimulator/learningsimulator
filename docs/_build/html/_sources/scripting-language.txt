Scripting Language Reference Manual
***********************************

This section describes the structure of a simulation script and the
scripting language that is used to specify the system to simulate.

.. _structure-of-a-script:

Structure of a script
*********************

The main components of a script are the following:

- Assigning values to :doc:`parameters <parameters>` and :doc:`global variables <variables>`.
- One or more :doc:`phase blocks<phase>` which specifiy the environment with which the subject interacts, in particular the sequence of stimuli to present to the subject, and how it depends on the subject's behavior.
- Run the simulation using one or several :doc:`@run<run>` commands.
- :doc:`postprocessing`: Plotting and/or exporting the simulation data.

The below example script highlights the typical structure.

Basic script language syntax
****************************

The specification of a simulation consists of the components described in :ref:`structure-of-a-script`.
This section describes the basic syntax in the scripting language used in these components.

.. _stimulus-specification:

Stimulus specification
----------------------

Stimuli are specified in various parts of the script, mainly on a :ref:`phase line<phase-line>` in a :doc:`phase block<phase>`,
where it tells the simulator which stimulus to present to the subject.

A stimulus consists of one or several stimulus elements. (The stimulus elements are specified with the parameter :doc:`stimulus_elements`.)
A stimulus that consists of more than one element is called a *compound stimulus*.
In a stimulus specification, each stimulus element has an *intensity* (which is any number).
If no intensity is specified, the intensity 1 is assumed.

A stimulus is specified as a comma-separated list of stimulus elements, optionally with the intensity in brackets after the stimulus element name,
for example ``e1,e2``, or ``e1[0.3],e2,e3[0.9]``.

.. note::

  The order of the elements in a compound stimulus has no effect on the stimulus representation, so::
  
    e1[0.3],e2,e3[0.9]
  
  represents the same stimulus as::
  
    e3[0.9],e2,e1[0.3]

A stimulus is often a single stimulus element, so a phase line
that exposes the subject to a stimulus may look like::

  L1 e | L2

If the stimulus to present to the subject is a compound stimulus of the elements ``e1``, ``e2``, and ``e3``, it looks like::

  L1 e1,e2,e3 | L2

but in general the syntax is::

  L1 e1[i1],e2[i2],...en[in] | L2  

where ``e1``, ``e2``, etc. are stimulus elements, and the intensities ``i1``, ``i2``, etc. are :ref:`scalar expressions<scalar-expressions>`.


Spaces
------

Leading and trailing spaces of a line are ignored. Also, spaces before and after assignment operators
(``=`` and ``:``) are ignored::

  @variables x    =   0
  n_subjects   =   10
  start_v      =   e1->b1 : 1,   e1->b2 : 2,  default: 0

Spaces before and after ``,`` and ``|`` in a :ref:`phase line <phase-line>` are also ignored::

  LABEL1  e1, e2,  e3      | x = 1, y=2,  pull_lever : LABEL2


.. _valid-names:

Valid names
-----------

Global and local variables, stimulus elements and behaviors can
have a short name (like ``x`` and ``y``) or a more descriptive name (``number_of_trials``,
``lever``, ``pull_lever``, ``food``, etc.). The rules for these names are the following:

A valid name

- must start with a letter or the underscore character
- cannot start with a number
- can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- is case-sensitive (``lever``, ``LEVER`` and ``Lever`` are three different names)
- cannot be a :doc:`parameter <parameters>`
- cannot be a :ref:`function <functions>` or a local phase function (:ref:`count <the-function-count>` or :ref:`count_line <the-function-count_line>`)
- cannot be ``default``


.. _scalar-expressions:

Scalar expressions
------------------

Numbers are specified in various parts of a simulation script, for example:

- The value of a :doc:`parameter<parameters>`::

    beta = number

- The value of a :doc:`global variable<variables>`::

    @variables x = number

- The value of a :ref:`local phase variable<local-phase-variables>`::

    @phase ...
    L1     | p=number, L2
    L2 ...

- A number in a :ref:`phase stop condition<the-stop-condition>`::

    @phase phase_name stop: s=number
    L1 s    | L2
    L2 ...   

- A number in a :ref:`phase line condition<phase-line-conditions>`::

    @phase ...
    L1 s    | b=number: L2 | L3
    L2 ...   

- A :ref:`stimulus intensity<stimulus-specification>`::

    @phase ...
    L1 s[number] | L2
    L2 ...   

- In :ref:`probabilistic go-tos<probabilistic-go-tos>`::

    @phase ...
    L1 s | L2(number1),L3(number2)

- As input argument to :ref:`functions<functions>`::

    x = rand(number1, number2)
    y = choice(number1, number2, [number1, number2])

These numbers must be *scalar expressions*, that is, an expression of numbers and variables that evaluates to a single (scalar) number.

For example, number literals are scalar expressions::

  1, 2, 42, 1.42, -110.33

With a number of global variables defined::

  @variables x=1, y=5, z=6.78

the following are also scalar expressions::

  x+y,  -3*x+5.65*y, 3.2*10**x-1

The output of :ref:`functions<functions>` are also single numbers, so the following are also scalar expressions::

  rand(x,y),  rand(x, y+1),  3*choice(x, y, z, [3, x, y+1])


.. _functions:

Functions
---------

The below builtin functions are available in *Learning Simulator*.
They can be used in :ref:`scalar expressions<scalar-expressions>`, and in conditions (:ref:`phase stop conditions<the-stop-condition>` and :ref:`phase line conditions<phase-line-conditions>`).

.. _choice-function:

choice
......

The function ``choice`` returns any of the specified values, each with a specified probability. For example::

  x = choice(4, 6, 2, [0.3,0.5,0.2])

returns 4 with probability 0.3, 6 with probability 0.5, and 2 with probability 0.2.

.. _rand-function:

rand
....

The function ``rand`` returns a random integer in a specified interval, for example::

  x = rand(2, 6)

returns a random integer in the interval [2,6], in other words any of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with
equal probability (0.2) each.

Case-sensitivity
----------------

Parameter names are not case-sensitive: ``beta = 0.5`` is the same as ``Beta = 0.5`` or ``BETA = 0.5``.
Parameter values that are not user-defined, such as ``on`` and ``off``, ``exact`` and ``subset``,
and the mechanism names (``sr``, ``ac``, etc.) are also not case-sensitive.

User-defined names, such as global variables, local phase variables, names of stimulus elements and behaviors,
and phase line labels, *are* case-sensitive: ``x`` and ``X`` are different variables (or element names or behaviors or phase line labels).


Comments
--------

Comments can be used in the scripting language to make custom comments to the simulation script,
and to temporarily "comment out" parts of the script. Comments are ignored by the script parser
and therefore not considered in the simulation.

The *Learning Simulator* scripting language has two kinds of comments: *end-of-line comments* and *block comments*.

End-of-line comments starts with `#` and extend to the end of the current line, for example::

  alpha_v = 0.4  # This is a learning rate
  # This whole line is also an end-of-line comment

Block comments starts with a line that only contains ``###`` (disregaring leadning and trailing spaces),
and ends with another line that only contains ``###`` (disregaring leadning and trailing spaces). For example::

  ###
  This is
  
  a block
  comment
  
  ###


Parameters
**********

A simulation uses a number of *parameters*, for example how many subjects that
should be simulated. Therefore, in order
to run a simulation, a number of parameter values must be set.

See :doc:`parameters` for the documentation of the parameters.

Global variables
****************

A simulation may use custom variables using the ``@variables`` keyword. 
We call these *global variables* to distinguish them from
:ref:`local phase variables<local-phase-variables>`.

See :doc:`variables` for the documentation of global variables.

Phases
******

The environment that the subject interacts with is specified using one or more ``@phase`` blocks.
A ``@phase`` block defines the sequence of stimuli that the subject is exposed to, and how the next stimulus
in the sequence depends on the response to the previous stimulus.

See :doc:`phase` for the documentation of a ``@phase`` block.

The command ``@run``
********************

The command ``@run`` starts a simulation.

See :doc:`run` for the documentation of the ``@run`` command.

Postprocessing
**************

The postprocessing stage of a script processes the data from a finished simulation.

See :doc:`postprocessing` for the documentation of posprocessing functions.

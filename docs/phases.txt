phases
******

Specifies the phases to use in plotting commands.

Syntax
------

::

  phases = all
  phases = phase_label_1
  phases = phase_label_1, phase_label_2, ...

where each ``phase_label_i`` is a ``@phase`` label.

Default
-------

``all``

Description
-----------

``phases = all``

plots the value of the the variable in question at each stimulus and each response in the stimulus-response history.

----

``phases = phase_label_1``

(where ``phase_label_1`` is a ``@phase`` label) plots the value of the variable in question only within the phase with label ``phase_label_1``.

----

``phases = phase_label_1, phase_label_2, ...``

(where ``phase_label_1``, ``phase_label_2``, ... are ``@phase`` labels) plots the value of the variable in question
within the phase with label ``phase_label_1``, followed by the phase with label ``phase_label_2``, and so on,
`in that order`. In other words, the order of the phase labels matters:

::

  phases = phase_label_1, phase_label_2

is not the same as

::

  phases = phase_label_2, phase_label_1


Example
-------

::

  phases = all
  @wplot e1

will plot the w-value of ``e1`` within all phases.


Example
-------

::

  phases = phase1
  @wplot e1

will plot the w-value of ``e1`` only within the phase with label ``phase1``.


Example
-------

::

  phases = phase2, phase1
  @wplot e1

will plot the w-value of ``e1`` within the phase with label ``phase2`` followed by the phase with label ``phase1``,
in that order.

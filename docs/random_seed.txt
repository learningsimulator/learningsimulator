random_seed
***********

Sets a seed to the random generator used in the simulations. This is useful when wanting the result of a script to be reproducible,
even though the decisions about behavior responses are taken using a random function. It may be set anywhere in the script.

.. note::

  The parameter ``random_seed`` can only be specified once per script.

runlabel
********

In a script with several ``@run`` commands, ``runlabel`` specifies which of the ``@run`` commands to use in postprocessing.

Syntax
------

::

  runlabel = name

Default
-------

If not specified, the postprocessing commands will use the output from the last ``@run`` command.

Description
-----------

``runlabel = name`` will make the postprocessing commands use the output from the ``@run`` command with label ``name``.

To put the label ``name`` on a ``@run`` command, use 

::

  @run phase_name runlabel:name

Example
-------

::

  @run phase_name runlabel:run_label1
  ...
  @run phase_name runlabel:run_label2
  @vplot ...

will make ``@vplot`` use the output from the last ``@run`` command (``@run phase_name runlabel:run_label2``). To use
the output from the first ``@run`` command (``@run phase_name runlabel:run_label1``), use

::

  @run phase_name runlabel:run_label1
  ...
  @run phase_name runlabel:run_label2
  runlabel: run_label1
  @vplot ...

subject
*******

Specifies the subject to study in the postprocessing commands, such as plotting and exporting.

Syntax
------

::

  subject = index
  subject = all
  subject = average

where index is a scalar expression evaluating to a positive integer (1-based index into the simulated subjects).

Description
-----------

``subject = index`` uses only the subject with index ``index`` in the subsequent postprocessing commands.

----

``subject = all`` uses all subjects in the subsequent postprocessing commands. In plotting commands,
this will produce one line per subject.

----

``subject = average`` will compute the average value of all subjects in the subsequent postprocessing commands. In plotting commands, this will produce one single line, representing the average of all subjects.

Dependencies
------------

- When specified as an index, this index must be :math:`\ge 1` and :math:`\le n` where :math:`n` is the value of ``n_subjects``.

Examples
--------

::

  n_subjects = 10
  subject = all

will make the plotting commands render 10 lines, one per subject.

::

  n_subjects = 10
  subject = all

will make the plotting commands render one line showing the average of all subjects.

::

  @variables p = 5
  n_subjects = 10
  subject = p + 1

will make the plotting commands render one line showing the values for subject number 6.
